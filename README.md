# fil-bud-rent-ex-pol

### Final project for SDA course "Java from scratch" - construction equipment rental.
Name came from various suffixes used by polish small businesses. For a joke I decided to use it all.

I'd like to use here:
* Spring Boot
* Spring JPA
* H2 database
* Thymeleaf for presentation layer
