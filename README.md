# fil-bud-rent-ex-pol

### Final project for SDA course "Java from scratch" - construction equipment rental application.
Name came from various suffixes used by polish small businesses. For a joke I decided to use it all.

I'm using here:
* Spring Boot
* Spring JPA
* H2 (in memory) database
* Thymeleaf for presentation layer
